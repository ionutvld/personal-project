      <p class="why-development">Why did I choose Web Development? First of all, it gives you the opportunity to create something out of nothing and leaves room for creativity, which is very satisfying. Another reason would be flexibility. As a front-end developer, you can work from anywhere, including home. This makes it one of the most flexible careers you can choose. The skill set you acquire allows you to work in different areas like Image editing, UX/UI, mobile development and more. Front-end web development is an exciting career because it’s always evolving and constantly changing. This means you’ll always have the opportunity to interact with new tools and learn new skills, keeping you engaged in your career. It’s a field that provides many opportunities for hands-on learning.
